Fortress Blast is a SourceMod plugin for Team Fortress 2 that adds collectable powerups from the Marble Blast series and more into TF2. It can be run on top of other game modes and server mods. Fortress Blast comes with support for some official maps, as well as an entire library of official and custom map support available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Fortress-Blast/Fortress-Blast-Maps), but can be safely run on non-supported maps. Plugin contributors are listed on the official wiki and in the [player manual](https://fortress-blast.github.io/index.html) accessible through the in-game MOTD.

To find a server running Fortress Blast Ultra, open Team Fortress 2, click **Find A Game** and then **Community Servers**. In the browser that opens, type in the tag `fortressblast`, then click **Refresh all**.

A powerup bonanza!
------------------

The lifeblood of Fortress Blast is its powerups, and *here are just a few examples:*

- **Effect Burst** - Each enemy close to the user is afflicted with one of four random status effects.
- **Frost Touch** - For 8 seconds, when the user touches an enemy, they turn into an ice statue for 3 seconds.
- **Mega Mann** - The user becomes 75% larger and is overhealed to 4 times their current health for 10 seconds.
- **Super Bounce** - Forced to bounce off the ground, the user can maintain their verticality 5 seconds.
- **Time Travel** - The user is invisible, has increased speed and cannot attack for 3 seconds.

Heavily customisable!
---------------------

Fortress Blast comes with several quality-of-life features, *such as:*

- A MOTD is available to players, containing information on the plugin's controls and powerups.
- A server admin can allow players to drop Fortress Blast powerups on death with a ConVar.
- Bots can pick up powerups and randomly use them based on a user-defined range of time.
- By default, Mannpower powerups are replaced with Fortress Blast powerups.
- A debug ConVar is available to test the plugin without having to check the server console.

Full of gifting spirit!
-----------------------

Within Fortress Blast is an optional mini game mode called **Gift Hunt**, in which teams are required to collect gifts scattered around the map before they can complete the objective. It can support both symmetrical and linear maps, and it comes with several ConVars that make it similarly customizable to the rest of the plugin.
